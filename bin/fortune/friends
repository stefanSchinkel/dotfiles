Ross: ...and this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?

I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking. 
Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls.

Monica: You kissed a guy? Oh my God.

Monica: Wait a minute, you staid home all day playing Ms. Pacman, 
while I was at work like some kind of chump? 
Chandler: Yeah, and I got all the top ten scores and

Monica: What is the matter with your hand? 
Chandler: Well, I've been playing for like eight hours.

Monica: Chandler, why would you do that? 
Chandler: Because it's awesome. 
Monica: You think this is clever?

it is a bit of a challenge. 
Monica: Wait a minute, this one's not dirty. 
Chandler: Well, it is, when you put it together with that one.

Chandler: Look at that, look at that, it's still there, 
this thing must have a primitive ROM chip! 
Monica: You gotta beat your scores. 
Chandler: With the claw? 
Monica: Fine, I'll do it. We gotta get this off the screen.

Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? 
I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that
... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, 
you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? 
I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.

She's allowed to see me naked.

The eagle, however, misconstrues it as an act of aggression and grabs the baby in its talons.

Baby and bird still ablaze are locked in a death grip,

You bet on a bet, and if you lose you lose the bet. 

%

Rachel: Finally. I get to see what Joey Tribianni is like on a date.

Monica: Me too. 
Chandler: You know, I was, uh, thinking. If you and I had a big fight and broke up for a few hours...

Ross: [stares at Joey... ] No! OK? Why does everyone keep fixating on that? 
She didn't know. How should I know? 
Chandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...

could that be why they're extinct? 
Ross: Joey, homo sapiens are people. 
Joey: Hey! I'm not judging here. 

%

Chandler: Where is Ross at? Hasn't he checked out yet? 
Monica: Are you kidding me? It's not 11:00 yet that means 
Ross still has 11 mins to check out of the hotel, 
and Ross has NEVER checked out of a hotel early. 
Rachel: Oh yeah that's right. One time Ross and I were at 
a hotel and we got a late check out
... Ross was so happy it was the best sex we ever had! 
Phoebe: Ohhhhhhh! 
Rachel: That is until he screamed out RADISON at the end. 
Phoebe: Yeah that'll kill it. 

%

Ross: I guess I should have known... we'd be out somewhere,

Chandler: Ugh, I hate when my father calls me that. 

%

Chandler: Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had 
a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. 
You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. 
Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, 
and that is why we don't do it. I don't think that was my point. 

%

Chandler: All right, kids, I gotta get to work. 
If I don't input those numbers... it doesn't make much of a difference. 

%

Ross: You know, you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a major crush on you. 
Rachel: I knew. 
Ross: You did. Oh... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother. 
Rachel: I did.

%

Susie: How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over? 
Chandler: Because I went to an all-boys high school and God is making up for it. 

%

[Ross is newly divorced from his lesbian wife] 
Ross: You know what the scariest part is? 
What if there's only one woman for everybody, you know? 
I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it? 
Unfortunately, in my case, it was only one woman for her. 
Joey: What are you talking about? One woman? That's like saying there's only one 
flavor of ice cream for you.
Let me tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. 
There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing. Cherry Vanilla. 
You could get them with jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream. 
This is the best thing that ever happened to you. 
You got married, you were, what, eight? 
Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon. 
Ross: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny. 
Chandler: Stay out of my freezer. 

%

[Chandler and Joey emerge from the bathroom after hiding from a fight between Ross and Monica] 
Chandler: That was pretty intense, huh? 
Joey: Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we 
were uncomfortable being out here. 
Chandler: I hope he did. 

%

Rachel: You don't want to try things too fast. 
You know what happened to the girl who tried things too fast? 
Jill Green: No. What? 
Rachel: Well... she died.

Joey: Pheebs, you wanna help? 
Phoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I really don't want to. 

%

Monica: 
Is it me? Is it like I have a beacon that only dogs and men with 
severe emotional problems can hear? 

%

Chandler: Hey, you know, I have had it with you guys and your "cancer" and 
your "emphysema" and your "heart disease." 
The bottom line is smoking is cool and you know it. 

%

Ross: You know what? I'd better pass on the game. 
I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover. 
Joey: The hell with hockey. Let's all do that. 

%

Monica: Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent? 
Joey: I'd probably kill myself. 
Monica: Excuse me? 
Joey: Hey, if "Little Joey"'s dead, then I got no reason to live. 
Ross: Uh, Joey... Omnipotent. 
Joey: You are? Ross, I'm sorry.

[a ritual to get rid of bad-boyfriend karma] 
Phoebe: Okay, now we need the sage branches and the sacramental wine. 
Monica: All I have is oregano and a Fresca. 
Phoebe: That's okay. 
[Adds them] 
Phoebe: All right, now we need the semen of a righteous man. 
Rachel: OK, Pheebs, you know what? 
If we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place. 

%

Rachel: Oh, honey. Don't get up. What do you need? 
Phoebe: Oh, no. Oh, nothing.

%

[Trying to fix up Monica with a date] 
Joey: Aw, c'mon, this guy's perfect for you. 
Monica: No, not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet. 

%

Ross: First divorce: wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. 
Second divorce: said the wrong name at the altar, kind of my fault. 
Third divorce: they shouldn't let you get married when you're that drunk 
and have stuff drawn all over your face, Nevada's fault. 

%

Monica: You wanted it to be a surprise. 
Chandler: Oh, my God. 
Monica: Chandler, in all my life I never thought I would be so 
lucky as to fall in love with my best, my best... 
[crying] 
Monica: There's a reason why girls don't do this. 
Chandler: Okay, okay I'll do it. I thought, wait I can do this, 
I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. 
Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, 
that you make me happier than I ever thought I could be and if you let me 
I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. 
Monica, will you marry me? 
Monica: Yes. 

%

Rachel: Oh my God. I've become my father. 
I've been trying so hard not to become my mother, I didn't see this coming. 

%

Rachel: See? Unisex. 
Joey: Maybe *you* need sex. I just had it a few days ago. 
Rachel: No, Joey, U-N-I-sex. 
Joey: I wouldn't say no to that.

Monica: Wow. You're a really good kisser. 
Chandler: Well, I have kissed more than four women. 

%

Chandler: Stay... stay. Good fake dog. 

%

Monica: That's probably because their nerves are deadened from being so stupid. 

%

Joey: Rach, you gotta find out if he's in the same place you are. 
Otherwise, it's just a moo point. 
Rachel: A moo point? 
Joey: Yeah. It's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo. 
Rachel: Have I been living with him too long or did that all just make sense? 

%

[Chandler walks in] 
Joey: You know, with that goatee, you kinda look like Satan.

Chandler: So when you said, "Get up early, " did you mean 1986? 

%

Monica: [chasing after him] 
Chandler. It happens to lots of guys. You-you-you were probably tired, 
you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it. 
Chandler: [motioning with his hands] 
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology. 
Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. 

%

[talking about engagement presents for Monica and Chandler] 
Rachel: Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? 
One of those little uh, portable CD players.

Rachel: Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey. 

%

Joey: [drinking a beer on the boat]

pee into the wind. 
Chandler: Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun,
I'm pretty much peeing every which way. 

%

Joey: Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, 
so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, 
take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. 
Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. 
That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' 
[Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend fishhook] 
Joey: Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13.
