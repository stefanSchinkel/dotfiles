# Post-Install for Ubuntu (22.04 LTS)

Works for me. Your milage may vary.

## Install needed pkgs

:exclamation: Make sure to check/understand before pasting blindly :exclamation:

### Batch install bare minimums
#### from repo
```sh
# refresh repos in case you didn't before
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install git make build-essential zsh vim tmux plocate wget curl
# and some extras (if you need and use gnome that is)
sudo apt-get install nextcloud-desktop keepassxc gnome-tweaks mc guake chromium-browser
```
#### from snap (optinal)
```sh
sudo snap install freetube
```
### get dotfiles
Only now clone repo (git is needed)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/stefanSchinkel/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

#### link dotfiles
```sh
ln -s .dotfiles/zshrc ~/.zshrc
ln -s .dotfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc
ln -s .dotfiles/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
```
### Setup zsh and p10k
#### install zsh
ohmyzsh more precisely

```sh
# run Deppeninstaller 
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```
#### make zsh default 
This is not needed if you set up zsh via the above wget
```sh
# OR make it default if installed already
sudo chsh -s $(which zsh) $USER
```
#### get p10
Details here: https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k?tab=readme-ov-file#oh-my-zsh
```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```
the .zshrc in the repo already has p10k set as default theme

#### setup fonts for p10k
```sh
cd ~/
wget https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Regular.ttf
wget https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Bold.ttf
wget https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Italic.ttf
wget https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Bold%20Italic.ttf
# either manually install w/ Fonts or do this
# cp to /usr/local/share/fonts and run sudo fc-cache -fv to update fonts cache
# AFTER that:
# set terminal to use fonts and run
p10k configure

```
### Install pyenv 
I (still) use pyenv, just because it works for me. Also the .zshrc already is aware the pyenv is being used. If it's not installed that my cause issues.

```sh
# install deps, some may already be there
sudo apt install -y libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev python-openssl
# and once more a Deppeninstaller
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```
Test if it works by install latest 3.10 and creating a playground env
```sh
pyenv install 3.10.13
pyenv virtualenv 3.10.13 playground
pyenv activate playground
# also set the global python version 
pyenv global 3.10.13 
```

### setup VIM
#### vim for GIT
First things first. Ditch nano.

```
git config --global core.editor vim 
```
#### colorscheme
For the .vimrc to work, you'll need zenburn. Here's how to get it. 
```sh
# get scheme
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnurmine/Zenburn/master/colors/zenburn.vim -O ~/.vim/colors/zenburn.vim
# link
ln -s ~/.vim/colors/zenburn.vim ~/.vim/bundle/Zenburn/colors/zenburn.vim
```
#### Note on black
The vimrc defines :Black to run on save (for python). Therefore make sure to have it installed in the venv you use when firing up vim or have installed systemwide. Otherwise vim will complain when you start editing Python code.

Also, you'll of course have to run :PluginInstall once.


### Install Codium (from repo)
It's nice to have a GUI based editor too. Especially for the debugger. 

```sh
wget -qO - https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/master/pub.gpg \
    | gpg --dearmor \
    | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/vscodium-archive-keyring.gpg
echo 'deb [ signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/vscodium-archive-keyring.gpg ] https://download.vscodium.com/debs vscodium main' \
    | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscodium.list
 sudo apt update && sudo apt install codium

```
### Setup Docker
We're installing docker-ce stable from the repos, not .deb

#### setup repository incl. GPG key adding
```sh
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

#### install docker-ce and friend
```sh
 sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
 # test
 sudo docker run hello-world
 ```
#### docker post install
This is needed for docker w/out sudo. To take full effect you'll need to logout/login once. But `newgrp` allow for testing w/out logout.
```sh
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
docker run hello-world
```

### Install rust
Rust is straighforward (of course with a Deppeninstaller). We install it after docker though, just to make sure that we can support multiarch builds

```sh
# install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# check
cargo -h
```
#### Multiarch support/cross platform compilation
```sh
cargo install -f cross
```
That's basically all needed. For verification use sth like this
```sh
# create a new dummy project
cargo new hello-world
cd hello-world
cargo run   # just to see if toolchain works on native arch
cross build --target --target=armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf  # or any arch of your choice
#
```
On first run it will get the build env as a docker image. Might take a bit. 

    Unable to find image 'ghcr.io/cross-rs/armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf:0.2.5' locally
    0.2.5: Pulling from cross-rs/armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf

    ...
    Compiling hello-world v0.1.0 (/project)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.28s

#
# check what we build
```sh

# target/armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf/debug/hello-world: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, with debug_info, not stripped
```

After it's build you can just scp/rsync it to your target (eg. a raspberry) and check if it works
```sh
scp target/armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf/debug/hello-world pi@raspberrypi.local # or however the Pi is called
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
# pi@raspberrypi.local>./hello-world 
# Hello, world!
# pi@raspberrypi.local>
```
